    <h1>The Peace of Wild Things</h1>
    <blockquote>When despair for the world grows in me<br>And I wake in the night at the least sound<br>In fear of what my life and my children's lives may be<br>I go and lie down where the wood drake<br>Rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds<br>I come into the peace of wild things<br>Who do not tax their lives with forethought<br>Of grief. I come into the presence of still water.<br>And feel above me the day-blind starts<br>Waiting with their light. For a time<br>I rest in the grace of the world and am free.</blockquote>
